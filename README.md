A native(Linux/Windows/Mac) port of android bionic c library
(currently based on android-4.3_r3.1 tag)

Looking for the way of building the native binary with gcc and compiler-spec.
(Very similar with the cygwin)

#### Linux : ANT-Build is OK
* working on Linux

#### MAC OS X : restructuring is needed!!
* The wrapping of MacOSX Libc is needed!!
* Assembly System-Call is not working (MacOSX is not linux)

#### Windows : few issues are remained!!
* CRT (begin/end) is not clear!!
